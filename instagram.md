# Managing the Instagram account

Someone needs to take charge of the Instagram account: [uct.mechatronics](https://www.instagram.com/uct.mechatronics/). People mostly don't like posting about their own research and need to be bugged/convinced/followed up etc to get anything done -- content most likely won't happen naturally!

Once you get used to running the account, it takes less than 30 minutes to post 1-2 times a week. If you suddenly have a lot of content, rather spread it out over a longer period and maintain the same posting frequency (there will be many periods where you have nothing to post)

Quite a few people have reported that they find the account interesting and inspiring - the work is certainly worth it!


## Types of content to post

The account has a range of followers, including UCT students and alumni, prospective high school students and other researchers. It's not always easy to find a balance between "technical enough to be interesting" and "not so technical that no one understands", but an easy start is to totally rule out jargon and acronyms

## Posting content

1. Get photo/video content. It should be _roughly_ square (limits being roughly 4:5 or 5:4 aspect ratio). The app can do some basic editing but cropping using some other program is generally easier. Everything should be the same aspect ratio

1. Write/get a caption and post on the #website Slack channel (or anywhere where at least one other person can confirm your spelling is correct, and that you haven't made mistakes about your understanding of the content). If using someone else's research, ask if they'd like to have their name included in the post (not everyone wants that)

1. Post onto Instagram and tell others so that they can share it, if they want


## Gaining followers

The account grows naturally, but make sure that it's mentioned/linked to at outreach events (like visits to high schools) and that you announce it on Vula in courses that you tutor/TA

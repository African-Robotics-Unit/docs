# African Robotics Unit documentation

## Newcomers guide
If you're new to Git/GitHub, please see the [newcomers guide](newcomers-guide.md). It's a work in progress! Our git cheatsheet is [here](https://github.com/African-Robotics-Unit/docs/blob/main/git-cheatsheet.md).

If you find yourself explaining a particular workflow as part of a project that you think will be useful in other projects, rather document it on this repo and link to it. Let's lean on the side of "bad documentation which incrementally improves over time" instead of "no documentation and a dead repo"


## List of links
If you're looking for a resource for a particular subject, check out the [list of links](links.md)


## Please contribute
It's super simple to improve docs directly from GitHub:

- click on a file
- click the pencil icon on the right hand side to edit the file
- make your changes
- preview the file to make sure it renders nicely
- type a short message summarizing the change you made
- click "Create a new branch..." if you'd like someone else to check the change before it's made
- click "Commit changes"

You don't need to ask for permission

Otherwise, if something is wrong/unclear/whatever but you don't know how to change it, [raise an issue](https://github.com/African-Robotics-Unit/docs/issues/new)

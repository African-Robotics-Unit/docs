- click on a file
- click the pencil icon on the right hand side to edit the file
- make your changes
- preview the file to make sure it renders nicely
- type a short message summarizing the change you made
- click "Create a new branch..." if you'd like someone else to check the change before it's made
- click "Commit changes"

You don't need to ask for permission

Otherwise, if something is wrong/unclear/whatever but you don't know how to change it, [raise an issue](https://github.com/African-Robotics-Unit/documentation/issues/new)
